# Machine Learning Project: Clothing Store Spending Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict customer spending behavior on a clothing website/app using machine learning. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains customer information and transaction details. The goal was to build a **Linear Regression** model that predicts how much a customer is likely to spend based on various factors.

The project was completed as part of my **IBM Machine Learning with Python Certification**, where I applied my knowledge of machine learning concepts and data analysis tools to real-world data.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Exploration:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights.
2. **Model Building:** Use Linear Regression to predict spending behavior.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using various metrics and visualize results.

## What I Did

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Loaded and examined the dataset.
- Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and converted categorical data into numerical values.
- Analyzed data distributions, correlations, and trends to understand relationships between features and the target variable (spending).

### 2. **Train-Test Split**
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to evaluate model performance.

### 3. **Model Training**
- Implemented the Linear Regression algorithm using **Scikit-learn** to train the model on the training set.
- Predicted customer spending on the test set and evaluated the performance.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Plotted predicted vs. actual values using a **scatter plot** to visually inspect model accuracy.
- Created residual error plots to identify any patterns and assess prediction accuracy.

### 5. **Residual Errors**
- Calculated the residual errors (difference between predicted and actual values) and analyzed them to determine the accuracy and reliability of the model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization and plotting.
- **Jupyter Lab:** For running and documenting the analysis.

## Results

- The **Linear Regression** model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset.
- A scatter plot comparing predicted vs. actual values revealed how well the model was able to generalize.
- Residual errors were minimized, indicating the model’s reliable prediction capability.

## Future Improvements

1. Experiment with other machine learning algorithms like **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting** to improve prediction accuracy.
2. Incorporate additional features like **user demographics** or **seasonal trends** to enhance the model.
3. Tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques such as **Grid Search** to find the optimal settings.
